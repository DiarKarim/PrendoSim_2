  - Title: Add new simulation procedure

    Details: "Simulation procedure based on object motion\n\n1.) Wait for grasp to
      stabilize\n2.) Start to inc. mass gradually (1.2kg per second)\n3.) Detect
      when object slips slightly (critical mass)\n4.) Wait for object to either fall
      off, or for a max duration time to be reached\n\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n   \\item
      The gripper/hand starts in a chosen orientation and with an open configuration.
      For the BarrettHand the index and ring digit proximal joints are  set to random
      angles (rotating on the z-axis).\n   \\item We randomly choose one of the target
      objects and hold it fixed in a randomly chosen orientation in front of the
      gripper for about 3 seconds.\n   \\item We drive each of the joints of the
      kinematic hand to transition from the open configuration to the closed one
      by following a sigmoidal motion curve over the course of 1s. \n   \\item Then
      we release the target object and let it physically interact with the closed
      grasp of the gripper.\n   \\item The object will either fall off to the group
      due to gravity, in which case we go back to the start of this cycle, or it
      will come to a stationary state in the gripper for at least 2 seconds. We consider
      this a successful grasp configuration of the gripper. \n   \\item To evaluate
      the stability of this successful grasp, we then start to gradually increase
      the mass of the target object at a rate of 1.2kg per second. \n   \\item We
      measure take note of the target object's mass at a point at which the object
      moves from it's stationary state, critical mass.\n\\end{enumerate}"
